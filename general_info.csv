The single biggest corporation, in regards to commericial success - Coca Cola. The bastions of how to market successfully. Have decided to throw away their humanity, and any semblance of the christmas spirit.. with this. A full AI generated commercial. With no human actors, no human animators. And no soul behind the eyes. This is a move that deletes careers. Removes authenticity. And will very likely empower others to do the same. The art of the commercial is dead. Welcome to the new era. This is so so deeply disheartening to see. Especially from a company that has the fewest excuses to cut corners. The spirit of Christmas is dead. The entire thing is as fake and soulless as the corporation itself. Leaving millions to discover: No...
