On the other hand, the average viewer isn’t analyzing the number of wheels on the trucks or the oddity of a sloth in the snow. Was there an uproar in past years when polar bears popped open and drank bottles of Coke? No. Why? Because this is FANTASY. There isn’t a gigantic Santa propelling a soft drink caravan down the road. Lights don’t magically turn on when said caravan passes by. There are no drivers in the trucks. Did anyone consider that this bears a not-inconsiderable resemblance to an electric toy train of old? Lionel locomotives didn’t have engineers in them, and children often had to reposition errant cars on the track during their play time. What this DOES have is a catchy tune whose repetitive quality echoes the feel of “real” steam engines of the past — both toy and life-size — chugging along the railway. It’s an advertisement, not the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Does AI pose a threat to creative artists in a variety of fields? Absolutely.

There are some errors and it's a bit mismatched in some areas but that's not really a big deal. Personally I'm not fond of the music though. From what I understand a lot of the best ""AI generated content"" still requires an artist for compositing and post-processing, and that should still be done. It would still make the artist's workflow faster, less tedious, cheaper, which could allow them to tackle them more ambitious projects or just more projects in general. Eventually the AI will be able to output models and textures, so 3D artists will actually be able to work on it, because I believe for this they still need 2D artists even if it looks like 3D modeling. The AI will get better, company's ability to devise better workflows that utilize human capabilities will get better, and hopefully maybe eventually we can all be done working.",UCy51ODHkQw6DG7cSlYTd8RA,http://www.youtube.com/@kamikeserpentail3778,0,,

It's the same as the Luddites who destroyed looms during the Industrial Revolution. When a new, convenient, and efficient technology emerges, it's a historically natural course for companies to adopt it. If you feel wronged, just be better than machines or AI. Corporations aren't charities. There's no reason to tolerate inefficiency and risk while abandoning efficient technology. Accept that companies are meant to pursue and realize profits, not volunteer organizations. This video wasn't simply created with AI with a single mouse click. It was created through countless hands-on editing and polishing, resulting in such a natural result. The difference lies in whether you can create it quickly and efficiently with AI, or laboriously and time-consumingly with Adobe software. If you don't believe me, try creating a video like this commercial right now with AI. You'll realize that using AI requires specialized knowledge and isn't something just anyone can do.

No company wants to spend millions when they can get the same job done for a fraction of the cost. Creators, like me, want efficient tools—not expensive ones. Coca-Cola’s new ad? Great music, solid animation, nothing to complain about. If you’re afraid of AI, you’re in the same camp as those who once feared cars, electricity, airplanes, and even the church organ—an instrument once called the devil’s tool. Every generation fears the next big thing until it becomes normal. We thought the talking computer on Star Trek was fiction. Now it’s reality. You can fear it, or you can learn to work with it.

The internet responded like a pack of rabid elves. Comment-section mood recap: “Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.” Translation: they treated AI like a toddler discovering electrical sockets. “Pepsi wins without doing anything.” Coke speed-ran self-embarrassment; Pepsi farms passive XP. “AI slop is coming… Slopa-Cola!” Peak poetry. Shakespeare rises, sighs, returns to grave. “Real magic is hiring actual artists.” But that costs more than a Midjourney subscription and one intern typing “cute Christmas animals please.” “Darkest timeline.” When YouTube commenters turn philosophical, civilization is unwell. “Facebook mom energy.” Absolutely devastating. Corporate delusion summary: Somewhere at Coke HQ, a VP is sipping Zero Sugar and thinking: “Why don’t people love our 70,000 AI-generated woodland abominations?

The only reason people are willing to pay extra for Coke versus all the generic colas out there is the billions Coke spends on marketing. So it makes it extra baffling that one of the world's biggest marketers would outsource such a key advertisement to AI. Also, $8.5M is probably more like the cost of hiring 85 marketing employees (including benefits) than 1,700. Not to mention that I'm sure Coke has massive accounts with various top advertising agencies to make ads for them.",UC_NohN60gdrxKyClKch-KYw,http://www.youtube.com/@sacvideo1998,1,UgwMB9efoEiFMeT28Yl4AaABAg,@Micah-Ch6V8

(Gentoo penguins live in the subarctic such as the Falkland Islands and parts of the Antarctic, and while technically penguins sometimes interact with other species, they’re still on the literal opposite side of the globe from polar bears. The animals it shows next are from places between the North Pole and Antarctica, so it would have made much more sense to show those first instead of teleporting to Antarctica then going back north.) Also, the sizes are wrong. Emperor penguins typically hatch around August (technically around 65 days after incubation, but that’s often August). Assuming this is in December, the penguin would be around 4 months old, which would make it almost as tall as its parents by then. Adult emperor penguins have an average height of around 122 centimeters/four feet, so the baby emperor penguin should just be a little below that. Gentoo penguins are typically around 70-90 centimeters/27-35 inches tall, so the baby emperor penguin should be taller if they were next to each other. Also, that one baby emperor penguin has a fluffy white stomach instead of just being gray. Emperor penguins don’t the white stomach until after they get their adult plumage, and after that they are more smooth/shiny feathers rather than the fluff that baby penguins have. And the other one has some black feathers and looks like it’s in the middle of getting it’s adult plumage, which they don’t get until being around 1 year old, while this one would have to be around 4 months old. And if it were old enough to be getting its adult plumage, it would DEFINITELY have to be taller than the gentoo penguin. Also, the white “headband” stripe on gentoo penguins doesn’t usually also have extra white splotches below the eyes or off to the side of the eyes. (Also AI is bad. Use real artists.)",UCCpX7GpHFwPSHh6slbzK4BQ,http://www.youtube.com/@AsteraceaeArt,0,,

Even the ""Behing the scenes"" is just some AI dick jockeying at its best, gobbling down each others fattest phalus´ and stroking the ego to the absolute max, expecting praise, like from a toddler who just shat on the floor. And the pinnacle for me, is probably one of the sentences from one of the AI´s at the end: ""[...] Giving creatives more freedom, speed and control than ever before."" And i was asking myself.

Think of it like a search engine. Google ""uses"" the entire internet, including copyrighted articles and images, to build its index. We don't call that theft because it's transformative. It creates something new—a map of information. AI models do something similar. They don't store a library of Getty images to reprint. They analyze patterns, styles, and concepts from a huge dataset (which yes, includes copyrighted works) to learn how to generate new, original content. The law calls this ""transformative use,"" and it's a cornerstone of fair use. The lawsuits and settlements, like the Anthropic one I mentioned, are precisely about figuring out the licensing for that learning process. It's a new frontier, and the rules are being built in real-time.

Every major technological shift in creative tools gets called ""mediocre"" at first. The first CGI movies look laughable now. The first digital photos were grainy and worse than film. This is the awkward, experimental phase. Coke isn't saying this is the best art ever made; they're investing in and testing a new creative pipeline. And for a multi-billion dollar company, that's not just ""greed""—it's strategy. They have to explore new tech or they end up like Kodak or Blockbuster. Using AI now is a calculated risk. It's cheaper, yes, which allows them to experiment and learn without betting the farm. They're paying to figure out the next frontier of advertising. So I'm not justifying the final product's quality. I'm recognizing that this is what innovation looks like in its early stages. It's a company using its resources to explore a new, controversial, and ultimately inevitable tool. It's less about justifying greed and more about identifying a technological shift in progress.",UChwXnR3_5d9scFOlwRIxncw,http://www.youtube.com/@NoahtheGameplayer,1,UgykvJhlJy1ARAGx2Sd4AaABAg,@BICEPSSSSSSSS

But here's the thing: having $50 billion in sales doesn't mean they should only do what's always been done. In fact, companies with those resources have a responsibility to explore new creative frontiers, even if not everyone will love the results initially. Think of it this way: when digital photography emerged, many photographers swore by film. When CGI entered movies, people missed practical effects. But these technologies didn't eliminate the old methods - they expanded the creative toolkit. Coca-Cola can still make those classic Hollywood-style productions (and probably will for certain campaigns) while also experimenting with AI. It's not an either/or situation. They're diversifying their creative approach to reach different audiences in different ways. And who knows? Perhaps this AI experiment will lead to a hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds - the efficiency of AI with the authenticity you're craving. Innovation needs space to breathe, even from the most traditional of brands.",UChwXnR3_5d9scFOlwRIxncw,http://www.youtube.com/@NoahtheGameplayer,1,UgykvJhlJy1ARAGx2Sd4AaABAg,@BICEPSSSSSSSS

The difference is that the internet had a concrete use case, worked for that use case immediately, and didn't burn investor dollars faster than thermite with no path to profitability in sight. Also, just FYI, this ad still took 100 people, they still used CGI/3D modelling (as shown in the behind the scenes video, where you can can clearly see the bottle being previewed in 3DS Max) and the AI portion took cherry picking from around 70,000 clips.
